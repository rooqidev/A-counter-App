// A simple counter app

I build this small counter app where you can do countings without forcing your brain & eyes to be active & focus on one thing, count freely & without worrying about missing any item.

One more reason i build this app, is to practice two simple design rules, 1st: Leave enough spaces, 2nd: use only 2-3 colors, I'm not a designer but i love building web applications with simple & clean uis, & small tools that do something.
